# Project Description:

As per the FRC proposal, the topic for the project is a Volunteer Matching System  VMS .
The student teamʼs role is to create a database and define usage to support the matching
of Red Cross Volunteer Capacity (supply) with “Local Multidimensional Vulnerabilities and
Crises” (demand).

# Project flow: 

## Part 1: UML and Relational Model:
- Draw a UML diagram for the Volunteer Matching System  VMS  database based on
the information defined in this document using the notations taught in the course.
- Convert the UML diagram to the relational data model, present the schemas of the
relations, and underline the attributes which form the key for each relation.
- Provide answers to the following questions: What are the non-trivial functional
dependencies of the database? Are there any forms of redundancy or other
anomalies in the database structure? Is the database in the Boyce-Codd Normal
Form? If it is not, use the decomposition algorithm (submit both original and
decomposed version)

## Part 2: SQL Implementation: 

- Creating the tables in the database and insert the data into those tables.
- Implement views, triggers, and transactions to maintain data consistency
- Implementing data analysis using PostgreSQL or Python
